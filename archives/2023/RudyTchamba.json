    "Title": "ChatGPT's new 'Browse with Bing': Watching AIs stalk you is odd",
    "Description": "If you compare ChatGPT and Google Bard, one of the advantages Google’s Bard has had until now is that it answers you using current search data, while ChatGPT has been stuck working off data it was trained on from 2021. This means the chatbot didn’t really know much about the world and events after this time.",
